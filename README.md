# Coin Clicker 2
EDIT: I have decided to stop developing this game. Incremental games, in my own opinion, are simply far too addictive and can ruin lifes, myself being a victim of just that when I was younger. I will dedicate my efforts to create other types of game that hopefully provides a kind of mental stimulation that is healthier.

Coin Clicker 2 ~~is~~ was an incremental game with the goal of adding as few features as possible, but as many interactions between features as possible. This way, the game can be simplistic and incredibly complex at the same time.
